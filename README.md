<h1>Summary of the Paper</h1>
Fusion is a Second Degree Surface Interaction ($D=2$), occurring at the surface of Radiation Sources.

Fission is a Third Degree Surface Interaction ($D=3$), occurring when a Mass Structure fragments due to excessive Gravitation.

Both processes follow recursive energy exchange, not arbitrary reaction models.

This classification aligns nuclear physics with thermodynamics and gravitation, resolving long-standing inconsistencies.

This LaTeX document provides a rigorous, structured reformulation of nuclear physics under the recursive principles of UTE.
