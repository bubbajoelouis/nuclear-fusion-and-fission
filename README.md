<h2>The Recursive Classification of Nuclear Fusion and Fission: A Unified Theory of Energy Perspective</h2>

Fusion is a Second Degree Surface Interaction ($D=2$), occurring at the surface of Radiation Sources.

Fission is a Third Degree Surface Interaction ($D=3$), occurring when a Mass Structure fragments due to excessive Gravitation.

Both processes follow recursive energy exchange, not arbitrary reaction models.

This classification aligns nuclear physics with thermodynamics and gravitation, resolving long-standing inconsistencies.

This LaTeX document provides a rigorous, structured reformulation of nuclear physics under the recursive principles of UTE.


<h2>Mathematical Framework for Natural, Recursive, and Dimensional Nuclear Events in the Unified Theory of Energy</h2>

Under the <b>Unified Theory of Energy</b>, nuclear fusion and fission are not special, isolated phenomena, but rather natural consequences of recursive energy exchange.
