\begin{abstract}
Traditional nuclear physics classifies \textbf{fusion} as the process of combining atomic nuclei and \textbf{fission} as the splitting of heavy nuclei. However, under the \textbf{Unified Theory of Energy (UTE)} framework, these processes are better understood as \textbf{Second and Third Degree Surface Interactions, respectively}, within the \textbf{recursive structure of energy exchange.} 

This paper demonstrates how nuclear interactions are \textbf{not discrete, special cases of energy transfer}, but rather \textbf{fundamental, continuous processes occurring within the recursive fractal nature of energy transformations.} By recognizing fusion and fission as part of \textbf{a broader recursive system}, we clarify their underlying mechanics and provide a \textbf{unified perspective} that aligns nuclear physics with thermodynamics, gravitation, and radiation.

\section{Introduction}
The study of nuclear energy has historically been treated as an isolated domain, largely disconnected from \textbf{gravitational and thermodynamic frameworks}. The classical approach classifies nuclear fusion as a process that releases energy by combining light atomic nuclei and nuclear fission as a process that splits heavy nuclei, releasing stored energy. 

However, the \textbf{Unified Theory of Energy (UTE)} identifies both processes as \textbf{recursive energy interactions within different Degrees of Surface Interaction (D)}. These interactions are governed by the \textbf{fundamental theorem} of UTE:

\begin{quotation}
\textbf{Theorem 1:} Energy exists in three distinct states: as \textbf{Radiation, Gravitation, and Particulate Motion}. Each of these states cannot exist apart from, or without, the other states.
\end{quotation}

In this paper, we formally classify:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nuclear fusion} as a \textbf{Second Degree Surface Interaction} ($D=2$), where atomic nuclei merge at the surface of a Radiation Source.
    \item \textbf{Nuclear fission} as a \textbf{Third Degree Surface Interaction} ($D=3$), where a heavy nucleus undergoes fragmentation due to an extreme Gravitation-Radiation imbalance.
\end{itemize}

This classification provides a \textbf{clear, recursive understanding of nuclear interactions}, rather than treating them as arbitrary processes detached from the broader framework of energy conservation.

\section{Nuclear Fusion as a Second Degree Surface Interaction ($D=2$)}
Nuclear fusion is the process by which two atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing Radiation in the process. Under UTE, this is described by:

\begin{quotation}
\textbf{Theorem 10:} A \textbf{Second Degree Surface Interaction} is any transfer of Energy whose \textbf{First Degree Interaction remainder Particles interact with the Mass Structure to form a new type of Atomic Structure at the surface.}
\end{quotation}

\subsection{The Recursive Energy Exchange in Fusion}
Fusion does not occur as an isolated, one-time event, but rather as part of a continuous \textbf{recursive energy exchange process}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step 1:} Particles receive Radiation from an Overgravitated Mass Structure.
    \item \textbf{Step 2:} These Particles accumulate enough stored Radiation to overcome the Coulomb barrier and merge.
    \item \textbf{Step 3:} The new Atomic Structure \textbf{sheds excess Radiation} in the form of electromagnetic waves.
\end{itemize}

This interaction occurs at the \textbf{surface} of a Radiation Source, such as a star, where the stored Gravitation is great enough to force atoms together. Thus, fusion is inherently a \textbf{surface-level interaction}, rather than a deep core event.

\subsection{Mathematical Representation of Fusion}
The energy transformation in fusion follows:

\begin{equation}
    G_{\text{stored}} + R_{\text{extended}} \rightarrow M_{\text{new nucleus}} + R_{\text{shed}}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G_{\text{stored}}$ is the Gravitation stored within the nuclei.
    \item $R_{\text{extended}}$ is the additional Radiation required to overcome repulsion.
    \item $M_{\text{new nucleus}}$ is the resulting fused atomic structure.
    \item $R_{\text{shed}}$ is the excess energy released after stabilization.
\end{itemize}

This directly aligns with the \textbf{Second Degree Surface Interaction} definition.

\section{Nuclear Fission as a Third Degree Surface Interaction ($D=3$)}
Fission occurs when a \textbf{heavy atomic nucleus} becomes \textbf{overgravitated} and splits into smaller nuclei, releasing Radiation and Particulate Motion. UTE defines this as:

\begin{quotation}
\textbf{Theorem 12:} A \textbf{Third Degree Surface Interaction} results in a physical change to the Mass Structure.
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Recursive Energy Breakdown in Fission}
Fission follows a \textbf{recursive fractal pattern}, where energy redistributes itself dynamically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step 1:} A large atomic nucleus accumulates excess Gravitation, storing it as potential energy.
    \item \textbf{Step 2:} A critical threshold is reached, destabilizing the Mass Structure.
    \item \textbf{Step 3:} The nucleus splits, releasing \textbf{stored Gravitation as Radiation} and creating \textbf{smaller nuclei.}
\end{itemize}

This energy redistribution follows a natural fractal \textbf{breakdown process}, rather than being an arbitrary splitting event.

\subsection{Mathematical Representation of Fission}
Fission is governed by:

\begin{equation}
    M_{\text{heavy nucleus}} + G_{\text{stored}} \rightarrow M_{\text{fragment 1}} + M_{\text{fragment 2}} + R_{\text{released}}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M_{\text{heavy nucleus}}$ is the initial overgravitated structure.
    \item $G_{\text{stored}}$ is the accumulated potential energy.
    \item $M_{\text{fragment 1}}$ and $M_{\text{fragment 2}}$ are the resulting fission fragments.
    \item $R_{\text{released}}$ is the Radiation and kinetic energy freed in the process.
\end{itemize}

Fission is, therefore, a \textbf{Third Degree Surface Interaction} because it results in a \textbf{physical restructuring} of the Mass Structure.

\section{Conclusion: Fusion and Fission as Recursive Processes}
Under the \textbf{Unified Theory of Energy}, nuclear fusion and fission are not \textbf{special, isolated phenomena}, but rather natural consequences of \textbf{recursive energy exchange}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fusion ($D=2$):} \textbf{Particles merge} at the Surface of a Radiation Source, forming new Atomic Structures.
    \item \textbf{Fission ($D=3$):} \textbf{Mass Structures fragment} due to excessive stored Gravitation, redistributing Radiation and Particulate Motion.
\end{itemize}

This recursive view of nuclear energy aligns \textbf{thermodynamics, gravitation, and radiation} into a \textbf{unified model of energy interactions.} Future work should explore how \textbf{higher Degrees of Surface Interaction} influence complex nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.
